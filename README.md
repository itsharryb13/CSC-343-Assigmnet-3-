Write a C++ program that creates an array of 20 elements. Fill the array elements by using the random number generator. Create a child process and find the minimum number in the second half of the array. The parent process will find the minimum number in the first half of the array. Display the minimum numbers found in each process and their processor IDs, and, finally, the minimum number of the array.
